And there are two stories about it, one of which is that the nurses noticed people on the trial when they came in for their kind of checkup. They were sitting in a really weird way. The other story I've heard is that at the end of the trial, they were told, well, could you hand back any unused pills you have? To which the response in every previous trial had been, yes, sure, here they are. And at this trial, they went, no! There's also a fascinating story, which is that a German pharmaceutical company got there first, noticed the side effect, and immediately rejected the drug. In other words, any angina cure that caused people to go around in a priapic state of tumescence was obviously no good as an angina medication, and they failed to see beyond it, which is that.

That period of life, just as important as what you're going to do, is what you're prepared to sacrifice. or if you need to stay late in the office three nights a week for the next six months so that your boss sees the work that you're doing or so that you get more sales in, your training's probably gonna take a hit. And when you start to see your condition or your fitness depreciate over time, if you're a Type A go-getter, you can feel uncomfortable and say, that shouldn't be happening, and then you take your eye off the ball of the thing that was supposed to be your thing for the next six months, and then go, I'll only stay late in the office one night a week, and I'll fit training, I'll slot training in two more nights. That wasn't the plan. The plan was put everything into this one thing, level myself up, and then play catch up with everything else to bring myself back up to baseline.

Blindly following your desires makes you a slave to your impulses. the advertisements you're exposed to, and the confused chemical signals of your body. If we don't pause and ask ourselves what we want to want, we will spend our lives focused on unhealthy aims defined for us by others in the worst parts of ourselves. If we don't cut to the core and program our wants, then our best case scenario is to be a rich, famous, or successful slave. In short, your default factory settings are shit. Don't follow them. The people who do this are never going to fully actualize their potential, either for happiness or for success.

The first method for estimating the intelligence of a ruler is to look at the men he has around him. If we look at the men and women around our contemporary rulers, what do we find? Few reasons for optimism. In two thousand eleven, the Royal Statistical Society asked ninety seven British MPs a simple maths question. If you spin a coin twice, what is the probability of getting two heads? Since the chance of getting a heads on one spin is fifty percent and two spins are in independent, the answer is just fifty percent times fifty percent. Twenty five percent. Not exactly quantum physics. Shockingly, only forty percent of MPs got the answer right. Among Labour MPs, it was only twenty three percent. Most of those who got the answer wrong said fifty percent, which is obviously incorrect when you think about it. So it just reminds us the people who are in charge are more stupid than you are and the bar is set unbelievably low. ",Are We Ruled By Midwits? | James Smith,60,44926

And no one ever stress tests the words coming out of your mouth. It means that appearing good actually becomes more important than doing good. The incentive of performative empathy kind of creates the basis for toxic compassion as a trend. Posting about mistreated groups is more incentivized than actually helping mistreated groups. All of the people who have put a flag in their bio but have never actually donated to a charity. And this isn't me saying that you can't do good whilst also talking about it.

They then changed their training and they would go and do Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu or yoga or CrossFit. And that precipitated a change in everything else. And I saw this in myself. I get to the end of my twenties, I've achieved success in many of the ways that society tells a young man that he should value success. There was a discordance, something fell off.

It also discusses the chewing of foods as essential to mouth and face development. Sandra Kahn is an expert in craniofacial function and structure.

And at night, your eyes are far more sensitive to artificial lighting and you need far less of it in order to disrupt your circadian system in bad ways, disrupt your mental health.

Women who reported high levels of intrasexual competitiveness were more likely to recommend that clients have more hair cut off when the hair was in good condition and the clients expressed a preference for minimal cutting. Another finding is that women advise clients of similar attractiveness as themselves to cut off the most hair. Participants effectively targeted women they perceived as being on the same attractiveness level, potentially to try and reduce their attractiveness. Longer hair is a cue to youth and health.

Resistance training has an interesting property that I haven't heard discussed before. that pertains to men and women who do it, which is unlike cardiovascular training. During resistance training bout, because of the blood flow to the muscle, the so-called pump, you get a little window into what the potential progress would look like. That pump dissipates post-workout and then if you allow sufficient rest and nutrition, et cetera, you'll get a hypertrophy response.

One is running voluntarily, but then that running wheel is tethered to a running wheel in another cage that encloses an animal, forces it to run every time the other one runs. So forced exercise versus voluntary exercise. And the takeaway is very straightforward. Voluntary exercise leads to all sorts of improvements in health metrics, resting heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose, resting blood glucose, et cetera.

If you never actually bother to reintegrate, or if you even make it so difficult to reintegrate because you can't remember what it's like to not do that, it's dangerous. Something that can be really really good in the first place can end up being toxic at high doses. Monk mode is one of those.

They take a shipload back to the prince of Spain. One of them makes it. that isn't rotten and the prince is allowed to eat it. It almost gets this sort of mythical quality to it. The British, they start to see it as this symbol of opulence, wealth. They would parade pineapples around at dinner on a platter and they would use them over and over and over again. You could rent a pineapple. This is the sort of house in which you might be able to see a pineapple. Castles had pineapple statues on the top of them. All of this occurred because of the scarcity of a pineapple. It was eight thousand pounds to get one pineapple. It was a symbol of privilege and opulence and wealth, people really looked up to this one object. Then the French, a couple of hundred years later, they invent greenhouses. Price drops. No one starts parading the pineapple around anymore. The scarcity of it was largely determining the value of it. ",The History Of The Pineapple | Patrick Bet David,0,59414

It's precisely Monk Mode's reliable effectiveness creates a problem because the dark side is that addictive lifestyle thing. Monk mode justifies a retreat from life and risk and self-adventure. It justifies it as self-development and it makes you feel noble in isolation, so much so that it can become hard to bring yourself back out.

Grandmother hypothesis says that why would you have female animal that exists beyond their reproductive window? If our goal is to survive and reproduce, as soon as you stop reproducing, surely kicking the bucket makes a ton of sense because get out of the way, let the calories go to the ones that are going to be able to survive if you can no longer make kids. But that doesn't account for the fact that the very effortful rearing that's required for human children. If you imagine that you have a particular fertility window, after that point, you as grandmother can no longer produce children that sap calories, but can contribute to the rearing of children, not only yours, but your daughter's and your sister's and so on and so forth. You age out of your reproductive role and move into a new kind of role. So you are still a net positive from a caloric perspective to the whole tribe. That's fascinating.

Let's take somebody like you, for example, who's got a big name on social media, looks great, access to loads of women through the nightclub. Now, if your body count is, let's say if it's ten, but you've had hundreds of girls throwing themselves at you, yours is actually still low. Whereas if another guy who has no access to women, but finally gets one or two girls to sleep with him, on paper it might be less, but his rejection rate is so low. So really look at how many people your partner is rejecting rather than just their body count. Because on paper, a really unattractive man who has nothing going for him, his body count is going to be low. It doesn't mean he's a decent man. It's just that he didn't have the opportunity. Similarly, women that are not that nice to be around, not that kind, not that pretty, not that attractive, hers is going to be low. It doesn't mean she's virtuous. It's just that she didn't have access. It's the ones that have access, but choose to be selective. That's what you should be looking at, is their selectivity.

Survivor guilt, someone goes away to war, all of their friends die, you get to come home and there's a very specific type of guilt that's associated with that which is his belief that he should have gone with his friends.

Now in twenty twenty three, the fertility rate is one point five four. It hasn't had a massive increase, but it's had had an increase.

One of the priorities is becoming then super cautious of the man that she allows to enter into the man's world. If she's a really good mother, she tends to keep a good co-parenting relationship with the ex, and a lot of men don't feel comfortable with that. But the true good woman, like the single mum that you should be looking for, is the one that's got a good relationship with her ex-husband. What men do is they prefer the woman that has no contact with the ex and the kids have never seen the ex. And they think, oh, I'll go for that girl. At least their baby father is not around. That's a signal that she deprives or prevents children from connecting with their father. That's not a good thing. That's not a green flag. That's actually a red flag. So what men are doing is sometimes they're selecting women and thinking she's got children, but she, she doesn't let the kids see their dad and they're not in his life and he was a bum.

And the reason why we kind of think like this is because we would rather have a friend who secretly loves us than a female friend that secretly hates us.

And there's a safety in a male friendship that we can't find in female friendships because it's very difficult to find women that are totally not threatened by you in any way, shape or form.

Because there's nowhere else to go. when your version of strength is, I have to suppress my anger, my anxiety, my sadness, my grief.

user,"Talk to me about the problem with nice guys. Essentially what nice guys do is what they suffer with is not that they're too nice or anything, it's just that they have incredibly weak boundaries when it comes to women. What they do is they blame the fact that they're so nice as to why they can't get women. But it's not about being nice, it's about a lack of masculinity. One of the best ways to establish masculinity is placing boundaries. When you don't like a behavior, you don't roll over. and allow it to continue and then give her more. in order for you to get her, you set a boundary and you have a willingness to walk away. Nice guys, what happens is they don't like to exert their boundaries and they don't have a willingness to walk away. So what ends up happening is a nice nature becomes a reason for resentment because women don't like it. They actually feel angry when you're too nice to them because then they don't feel protected. They feel like you're weak because you'll feel like she has to raise you and she'll lose respect for you. What we truly want is we can trust makes good decisions. But the one that doesn't trust his own decision-making and we have to do it and he comes across as being nice, essentially he's seen as weak. ",The Problem With Nice Guys | Sadia Khan,60,57022

I want to be happy like many people do, but I did something that most people don't do, which is try to figure out how the hell do you actually be happy? One of the things about actually being happy is that you need to get out of your head. Most people who are, again, the type of people who listen to podcasts, they are in their head. They try to think their way through life. They think their way through problems and that serves them. But then they think they can think their way through feeling. That's not how emotion works. I thought if you think a certain thing, you will feel a certain way, which will lead you to do a certain thing. If I think that this person just cut me off while I was driving, I will feel pissed. I'll feel angry and I will then do something in retaliation. I thought it's a one-way street. Then I realized like math equations and math equations are reversible.

But when I looked at tons of studies, when I looked at apples and art galleries, it's so clear that much of the work is being done in psychology, not in reality. If we just think about the Apple store, Every electronics store you've ever walked into in your life is kind of like a crazy jungle of wires, right? That's how electronics stores always were. What Apple did differently was they gave the iPhone space in the shop. So the space that the object is given actually pours into the value of the object itself. Because it has two feet either side of it, the frame in which it's presented is telling you that this item in the middle is high value. The context you've always seen that kind of framing in is an art gallery. The other thing I think is so critical is they only show you one of each device and they keep the rest in the back room. If we think about scarcity creating value, the frame in which you present something is doing so much of the work to communicate the value of the thing within it.

Guys will say, say more, uh, what you optimize for in a one night stand and what you optimize for in a marriage partner aren't always necessarily the same thing. I would think they would be wildly disparate. Correct. Which means that the front cover of the romance novel is not necessarily the partner that you want long-term. They're the one that you want to fantasize about. Most of these stories are driven by s**t rather than driven by love. There's massively a difference between stated and revealed preferences.

user,What's the role of Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in the current economy in your eyes? ,Is Cryptocurrency A Reliable Investment?,60,4072
assistant,"I think cryptocurrency or Bitcoin doesn't move in a reliable way related to almost anything. Unlike gold, crypto, it's very easy to track the owners and transactions. It's not like by the government, it doesn't move in a way that's consistent with kind of any of the environments. And it's a small asset class, but its size is about thirty percent of the size of Microsoft. And Microsoft is one stock among many stocks. I don't understand why people are more inclined to go to Bitcoin than gold. If you look internationally, gold is for central banks the third highest reserve asset and central bankers are buying gold and they're not buying bonds. and it's timeless and universal. I don't know. I don't think a lot of Bitcoin. ",Is Cryptocurrency A Reliable Investment?,4192,51109
user,"What do you think it is about the guys that are the most dangerous being more unassuming? Which way do you think that arrow of causality runs? Do you think it's because they're so dangerous that they choose to be unassuming, or is it in the other direction? ",What Makes Dangerous Men Less Assuming?,60,13519
assistant,"I am not sure, but I think humility opens up. Humility is a seed that will reap a harvest of, I think, blessing on the other end. And so a really arrogant guy is very hard to teach anything to. And so that's part of it. So that could be really pragmatic and easy to see. ",What Makes Dangerous Men Less Assuming?,13780,30455

I went from having a Friday afternoon itch, which was this compulsion, this desire to party like I just wanted to go out and get up, even if it wasn't kept up. I just wanted to go out.

user,"A person obsessing over politics is a good indicator that their personal relationships are a mess. Unless they're financially invested in the political sphere, they're probably compensating for feeling powerless in their life. ",What Obsessing Over Politics Says About You,220,11517
assistant,"I mean, that's a large part of what drives Twitter's business, is arguing over who is going to save us best. who should be the enemy and who we outside and who we exile. If they're doing that, that's not done by people who are happy. The happiest people are not on social media yelling about politics. Every single time I have seen someone come into my therapy office or now my coaching and start talking to me endlessly about this is so important, this person and this, I say, okay, let's steer it back to your life. They will steer it away from their life back into politics because they think that they are showing who they are by following the right things and having the right politics. And they think that that gives them value. And again, they're trying to be interesting. They're trying to stimulate. They're not even having a real conversation. They're not discussing it. It is just a compensation in every capacity. And they will not talk about the gaps in their own life. They want to run away from that. ",What Obsessing Over Politics Says About You,11737,58014
user,"People's actions are way less visible than their words online. The thing that you tweet is way more important than the thing that you did, because no one sees the thing that you did, but they see the thing that you tweeted. When you look at the people that are the most forthcoming about being virtuous or morally grandstanding, or I'm holier than thou, when you see that, that to me, a lot of the time signals there's probably something going on there, unless I can really, really prove it. And I didn't see it with Lizzo, not that I, I'm like a Lizzo scholar. Yeah, I didn't look at her and see, yeah, this is someone who's really working hard to try and find the next frontier for female body empowerment or something like that.

user,"It's very important for the child to lie on the father's chest, skin to skin contact. How much of this is bro science and how much of this is legit? ",Why Children Must Lie On Their Father's Chest After Birth,60,7511
assistant,"Absolutely legit. There's one thing I will tell a father after birth is put that baby on your chest. The reason for that is human babies are sensory beings like a lot of little baby mammals. Their senses are very heightened. One of the senses that's not heightened is vision, but they are amazing at smelling, they're amazing at feeling and touch. So if you put them on your chest as a father, first of all, they smell you and they start to smell who you are because they can't really see you. Secondly, a wonderful thing called bio-behavioral synchrony happens. When you put a baby on your chest, their physiology starts to go into time with your physiology, so they'll come to the same temperature as you. Their heart rate will come to the same heart rate as you. Their blood pressure will come to the same blood pressure as you. Also, touch is the key releaser of bonding hormones. Oxytocin, dopamine, beta endorphins, if you want to release those, the best thing you can do is use touch. And it's really critical as the first interaction between a father and child.

Man, I feel sorry for you. When he said that, when he actually played out what my like revenge fantasy was in real life, I realized it looks stupid. Yeah, the only thing that you can do is win so big that all of them constantly compare themselves to you and then you'll forget they exist. Success is the only revenge. It's not the best revenge. It's the only one. There's no other revenge because everything else is petty. Everything else does show that you were thinking about these people all day long, which means they win by default.

user,"In nineteen ninety, the number of men who said they had zero close friends was around about three percent. Two thousand twenty, that number was fifteen percent. That's insane. The most common answer to the question, how many friends could you call on in an emergency, is zero. It's not the average, but it's the most common. More people have zero friends to call on than have any other number. The challenge of modern masculinity relates to that addiction quote, the belief that you can find fulfillment alone. And you see this in the Sigma male meme. Over the top of a lot of this meta meme, which has been created, is a guy called Chris Bumstead, who is a four-time classic physique champion, Mr. Olympia. I sit down with Chris, this guy who is the face of the Sigma male meme. And I asked him, how much of what you've done and achieved in business, in personal life, and in your sport could you have done on your own? Zero. I could have done none of it. The belief that you can find fulfillment alone is a lie that people who have been hurt and scorned and rejected by the world retreat into. ",How Friendships Have Deteriorated Over Time,60,53455
user,"What's going on with grey matter? What's happening to our brains? OK, so we see two key changes in the brain and they're identical in women. First of all, we see changes in the very core of the brain, particularly in the limbic area of the brain, the amygdala and the hypothalamus, which are related to risk detection. So as a parent, you need to be very good at risk detection. You need to look out for those risks to your baby. The second really big ones are in the outer areas of the brain. So we see the areas related to empathy, increase in size, which again is obvious. You need to be very good at reading your child's emotional needs, what their emotional state is, what they're going to need. And particularly when all you've got is somebody screaming at you, you need to be very good at that. The other thing is all those really good parenting skills like attention and planning and problem solving and organizing. So those areas of the brain associated with that related to executive function, they also increase in size. So you see all these areas becoming primed so that you are as good at this as you possibly can be. And we see that happening in men and in women. ",How Childbirth Affects Your Brain,60,52332
user,"the most dangerous men on the planet who I've worked with whether they were Rangers or SEALs, three-letter agency contractors. I work with all kinds of really dangerous dudes and at the very tippy top of those guys they're always these more humble unassuming guys. and I'm like what is that? And you realize the arrogant guy can only get so tough and can only get so far, but you have to be teachable. And to be teachable, arrogance will only let you get so far in that respect. And so I saw a lot of guys who were kind of PT studs, they'd get into Ranger Battalion and then they'd wash out. And then some other guy with less impressive physique, but he's got a longer suffering grit and character under the hood. He had deeper reservoirs in his soul to tap into. That dude didn't quit and he went the distance. We find incredible strength through humility. I do press in. It's not all fluffy, metaphorical stuff.

And he looks back and it's Agent Smith holding a gun to his head and he says, freeze. And then everything freezes in the frame. And he's like, if you're not one of us, you're one of them. I see that as the opportunities that we have to say no to every day is like another woman in the red dress.
